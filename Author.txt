This is purely a playground for code in selenium.
The insperation comes from my work (helping testers) or just plain curiosity.
I do think Selenium seems to be lacking in many ways.
So many basic classes have either been long unsupported or don't function as expected.
At the moment I am focusing on Chrome, but will evently wrap the drivers with an interface to create usable call methods (I hate having to specifically call chromedriver)
